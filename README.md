Project Title: Sudoku Solver in Python

Overview
This is a simple Python project that solves a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. The puzzle is represented using a 9x9 grid with 0 representing empty cells.

How It Works

The program searches for empty spaces.

It tries numbers from 1 to 9 in each empty spot.

It checks if placing the number follows the Sudoku rules.

If valid, it moves to the next cell.

If not, it tries the next number.

It uses backtracking to undo and retry if stuck.
